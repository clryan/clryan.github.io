Hi there! I'm a senior data analyst at DaVita, and I just finished a Master's in Business Analytics at the Carlson School of Management (University of Minnesota). My interests include predictive modeling, data visualization, statistics, and causal inference.  
I'm proficient in Python, R, and SQL, and I know a bit about CSS from building this site.

### Random Facts About Me

- I'm a typography nerd (ask me about my favorite monospaced font for programming).
- I lived in Lima, Peru for three years (ask me about Pisco Sours).
