Hi there! I'm a data analyst at DaVita, and I just finished a Master's in Business Analytics at the Carlson School of Management (University of Minnesota). I'm interested in predictive modeling and data visualization, as well as causal inference.

### Random Facts About Me

- I spent six years teaching English as a Second Language â€“ I've got the answers to all your grammar questions!

- I'm a typography nerd (ask me about my favorite monospaced font for programming).

- I lived in Lima, Peru for three years (ask me about Pisco Sours).
